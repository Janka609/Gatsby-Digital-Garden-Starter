# Cello
As you probably don't know,i play the cello.A cello is a string instrument that you play by sliding a bow on the strings.However,you can also play it by  plucking the strings, but only for practice.Once i didin't like my cello.I thought of it as extra homework.But one day i got some sense knocked in to me and i love the cello now.❤️🎵️Sometimes i compose my own pieces based on the begining of a piece i play.But of course,i don't make it public becouse that would be playgourism.And sometimes i just go along with what the sheet music says.
