# Introducing My Blog
Hi i'm Janka and welcome to my blog.In this blog i'll be talking about my life and my ideas.I know what you're thinking,you must be thinking:"Oh my god such a boring blog nobody wants to hear about your life,Janka". But no,i promise my blog will be better than that,so stay tuned and keep reading!üí™Ô∏èüî•Ô∏è

# Saving Our Planet

First things first,our planet.Do you believe in global warming?If not, than i promise you it IS true and if you dont believe me,you will see when our group of people save our planet and you will be proven WRONG.If you DO believe in global warming,i wish you a happy life and give you great love and support.‚ù§Ô∏è
I was actually planing to name my blog 'Our Planet' but then it came to me that i'm not going to write JUST about our planet and i couldn't think of a name so i just named it 'Janka's Blog'.Anyway thats all i wanted to say about global warming for now.See you in my next post.Bye!

# Cello
As you probably don't know,i play the cello.A cello is a string instrument that you play by sliding a bow on the strings.However,you can also play it by  plucking the strings, but only for practice.Once i didin't like my cello.I thought of it as extra homework.But one day i got some sense knocked in to me and i love the cello now.‚ù§Ô∏èüéµÔ∏èSometimes i compose my own pieces based on the begining of a piece i play.But of course,i don't make it public becouse that would be playgourism.And sometimes i just go along with what the sheet music says.

# School
Do you like school?I do but sometimes it can be pretty tiring.The good things about my school is that you can see your frends and get chocolates from the office ladies.The bad things? Well, the teachers don't even let you call your PARENTS when you miss them,you can't run in the corridors, and of course there is the extra homework on tuesdays.Anyway i like my school.And whats more its a MUSIC school so double yay.üéµÔ∏èüè´Ô∏è
# My Pets
I have got a LOT of pets.I have 2 gunea pigs,1 cat, and a dog.
It's a lot of things to talk about so lets go one by one.
Ok,we start from my gunea pigs.They are called Hummus and Palestine becouse when i got them Hummus has the color of hummus and its a mother and a daughter and Hummus comes from the country of Palestine,so it all works out.See?Anyway Palestine is COMEPLETELY diferrent from Hummus.It's hard to even BELIEVE that there mother and daughter.The only tell tale sighn is a pach on theyre buts that is always the same dull colour of brown.Hummus is a bit scared of me even though he and Palestine have been living with me in my room FOUR ALMOST FIVE YEARS,but Palestine has a better atitude.Sure she freaked out at the beggining but then her ADULT GUINEA PIG KNOWLEGE kicked in and the grew more and more used to me.
Now lets move on to the second animal,my cat.His name is Kotka Bronislaw Fluffus but we just call him Kotka.He is very sick at the moment with some serious stomach problems but we hope he will get better soon.He is the colour of gray with black stripes with white hairs growing out of his ears.He is very skinny and lovable,but sometimes he gets a bit cranky and scraches me.We can only feed him rabbit becouse of his stomach problems,but ocasionaly i get to feed him one little cat treat.
Now lets move on to the third and last animal:Brysiu.Brysiu is a old Bernese shephard dog and dosent want to run for long anymore,but believe me,when i come to my grans,he flies like the wind.When i lay down on the tarase on warm,sunny days at my grans.He comes and lays down next to me,licking my face.Well i guess this is the end of this post.I described every one of my pets wich are legally mine,so see you in the next post.Goodbye!
